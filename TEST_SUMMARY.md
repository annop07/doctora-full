## 📞 Test Commands

### Quick Test
```bash
./test-deployment.sh
./test-services.sh
```

### Manual Test
```bash
# Build
docker build -t doctora-backend:test ./doctora-spring-boot
docker build -t doctora-frontend:test ./FrontendDoctora

# Test
curl http://localhost:8082/api/health
open http://localhost:3000

# Clean
docker-compose down
```

## 💡 Notes

- Backend build takes longer due to Maven dependency downloads
- First build is slowest (subsequent builds use cache)
- All tests pass so far
- Ready for deployment after Docker builds complete
